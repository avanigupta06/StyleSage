## 🌟 About the Project  
**StyleSage** is a smart outfit search engine that reimagines fashion discovery.  
Instead of boring keyword search, you can type in **natural language vibes** like:  

- *“comfy outfit for a beach wedding 🌊”*  
- *“monsoon-ready ethnic wear ☔”*  
- *“movie night outfit 🎬”*  

👉 And StyleSage serves you **personalized, occasion-aware results** from Myntra’s product catalog — fast, stylish, and context-aware.
